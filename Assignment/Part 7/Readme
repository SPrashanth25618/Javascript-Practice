The delayedGreeter function prints "Hello, undefined" since var has function scope, and all the setTimeout callbacks use the same i value, which is 3 when the timeouts are called. This can be solved by using an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), which provides a new scope for each loop and captures the right i value. Alternatively, when using let addresses the problem because let enjoys block scope, permitting each iteration its own value for i, in such a manner that the names are printed accurately.
