Hoisting in JavaScript refers to the process of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope prior to code execution. Variables that are declared with var are hoisted and assigned undefined automatically, meaning you can use them prior to the line where they are written. But variables that are declared with let and const are hoisted as well, but their initialization is not done until the code hits their declaration. This generates a time frame referred to as the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) â€” if you attempt to access these variables prior to when they're declared, you'll have a ReferenceError. This is why, in the code snippet, attempting to access mysteryVariable prior to its let declaration results in an error.
