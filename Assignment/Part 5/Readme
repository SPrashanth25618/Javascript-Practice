The continue statement causes the current loop iteration to bypass and go straight to the next one. In a loop in which i === 2, for instance, it bypasses printing 2.
The break statement terminates the loop entirely. As soon as break is reached, none of the code inside the loop will run. For instance, when i === 4, it breaks the loop.
