A closure is a function that remembers variables from its outer context, even after the outer function has completed execution. For instance, increment and decrement functions retain their own count. The createGreeting function illustrates how closures allow you to create customized greetings, such as sayHi("Charanya"). Likewise, createSecretHolder employs a closure to make a secret privateâ€”only accessible via getSecret and setSecret, but the underlying variable is concealed from outside use.
